        <p>
            Scraper API (hereinafter referred to as “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Provider” or
            “Scraper API”) welcomes you (hereinafter referred to as “you” or the “User”) on our
            website scraperapi.com (hereinafter referred to as the “Website“).

            This Privacy Policy (hereinafter referred to as the “Policy” or “Privacy Policy”) describes the types of
            information we gather from people visiting our Website and/or using our Platform and Services. Terms
            starting with a capital letter used in this Policy have the meaning defined in our Terms and Conditions
            of
            Use (hereinafter referred to as the “Terms”). By accessing the Website, Platform or using our Services,
            you
            agree to adhere to this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the
            Website, Platform or any of our Services. Each time you use the Website, Platform or our Services, the
            current version of the Privacy Policy will apply.
        </p>

        <h2>General Principles</h2>
        <p>
            Scraper API may collect two types of information from Users: “Personal Data” and “Aggregate Information”
            (as
            defined below).
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
            Processing personal data in a secure, fair, and transparent way is extremely important to us at Scraper
            API.
            We process personal data in accordance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
            (“GDPR”)
            and best industry standards. This Policy uses the following definitions regarding your personal data:
        </p>

        <p>
            “Data Subjects” refers to those individuals residing in the European Union who are our Users or
            personnel.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Personal Data” is given the same meaning as in the GDPR, i.e. any data relating directly or indirectly
            to
            an identifiable data subject. Personal data does not include any data that is anonymized, aggregated,
            de-identified and/or compiled on a generic basis and which does not name or identify a specific
            individual,
            directly or indirectly.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Processing” is given the same meaning as in the GDPR, such as collecting, recording, using, storing,
            amending, adapting, disclosing, transferring or transmitting, structuring, using, combining, deleting or
            destroying personal data”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Controller” is given the same meaning as in the GDPR, i.e. a party that determines the purposes and
            means
            of the processing of personal data; Scraper API is the controller with respect to your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Processor” is the party that processes personal data on behalf of the controller; Scraper API is the
            processor of your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Incident” means: (a) a complaint or a request with respect to the exercise of an individual’s rights
            under
            the GDPR; (b) an investigation into or seizure of the personal data by government officials, or a
            specific
            indication that such an investigation or seizure is imminent; or (c) any breach of the security and/or
            confidentiality as set out in this Policy leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
            alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the personal data, or any indication of such
            breach
            having taken place or being about to take place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scraper API collects personal data that is voluntarily provided when a User on our Website creates an
            account or logs into their account. Specifically, when you sign up for an account, we ask you for your
            name,
            email address, username, short bio, homepage URL, GitHub username, Twitter username, profile picture,
            business information, billing information and payment information. This information is used to assist us
            in
            helping you select the appropriate service package, to allow you to authenticate to the Website
            (Platform),
            to send you e-mail notifications, Scraper API’s newsletters or other marketing materials. Some of the
            information might be displayed publicly on a public profile page upon your consent and only to the
            extent
            approved by you. Scraper API also collects and stores information about our user’s use of the Website,
            Platform and our Services, including page scraping activities, so that information gathered by a user
            through our Website or Services can be served up each time a user logs in to the Website.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scraper API will process User’s personal data only to the extent strictly necessary for the purpose of
            using
            the Website, Platform and/or providing Services in accordance with the Terms and this Policy and any
            further
            written instructions from the User that are mutually agreed upon in writing. Scraper API agrees that:
        </p>

        <p>
            it will implement and maintain a reasonable and appropriate security program comprising adequate
            security,
            technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized, unlawful or accidental
            processing,
            use, erasure, loss or destruction of, or damage to, User’s personal data; it will not modify, alter,
            delete,
            publish or disclose any User personal data to any third party, nor allow any third party to process such
            personal data on Scraper API’s behalf unless the third party is bound to similar confidentiality and
            data
            handling provisions;
            only its personnel, contractors or third party providers who “need-to-know” will be given access to User
            personal data to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under the Terms. It shall provide
            adequate
            training to its staff and ensure that they comply with the obligations in this Policy; and it will only
            process User personal data to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under the Terms, upon
            written
            instructions of the User (only as mutually agreed upon), and in accordance with applicable laws.
            Upon your request or termination of your user account, Scraper API will delete, destroy, or anonymize
            the
            personal data in accordance with our standard backup and retention Policy (no later than 60 days),
            unless we
            have terminated your account for violation of the Terms or in other cases foreseen by GDPR and
            applicable
            regulation in which we are not obliged to delete, destroy or anonymize your personal data.
        </p>

        <p>
            The parties acknowledge that User may from time to time be in possession of personal data relating to
            Scraper API’s personnel. Scraper API warrants that it has provided all necessary notifications and
            obtained
            all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals and/or agreements as required under any applicable law
            in
            order to enable: (i) the disclosure of Scraper API’s personal data to User; and (ii) further processing
            of
            such Scraper API personal data by User.
        </p>

        <h2>User’s Obligations</h2>
        <p>
            By accepting this Policy, the User warrants that it has all necessary rights to provide to Scraper API
            the
            personal data for processing in connection with the provision of the services by Scraper API. To the
            extent
            required by applicable law, the User is responsible for ensuring that any data subject consents that may
            be
            necessary to this processing are obtained, and for ensuring that a record of such consents is
            maintained,
            including any consent to use personal data that is obtained from third parties. Should such consent be
            revoked by a data subject, the User is responsible for communicating the fact of such revocation to
            Scraper
            API, and Scraper API remains responsible for implementing any User instruction with respect to the
            further
            processing of that personal data, or, as may be in accordance with any of Scraper API’s legal
            obligations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Scraper API shall assist the User by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures,
            insofar
            as this is reasonably and commercially possible (in Scraper API’s sole determination and discretion), in
            fulfilling the User’s obligations to respond to individuals’ requests to exercise rights under the GDPR.
        </p>

        <h2>Incident Management</h2>
        <p>
            When either party becomes aware of an incident that impacts the processing of personal data, it shall
            promptly notify the other about the incident and shall reasonably cooperate in order to enable the other
            party to perform a thorough investigation into the incident, to formulate a correct response, and to
            take
            suitable further steps in respect of the incident.
        </p>

        <p>
            Both parties shall at all times have in place written procedures which enable them to promptly respond
            to
            the other about an incident. Where the incident is reasonably likely to require a data breach
            notification
            under applicable laws, the party responsible for the incident shall notify the other no later than 24
            hours
            of having become aware of such an incident.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any notifications made under this section shall be made to support@scraperapi.com (when made to Scraper
            API)
            and to our point of contact with you (when made to the User), and shall contain:(i) a description of the
            nature of the incident, including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of individuals
            concerned and the categories and approximate number of records concerned; (ii) the name and contact
            details
            of the point of contact where more information can be obtained; (iii) a description of the likely
            consequences of the incident; and (iv) a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken to
            address the incident including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
        </p>

        <h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
        <p>
            Scraper API may also collect aggregate information. Aggregate information is information about your
            activities on the Website and Platform or in connection with the Services that cannot be used to
            identify,
            locate, or contact you (such as frequency of visits to the Website, data entered when using the Website,
            Website pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.). Aggregate information is collected as you
            visit
            our Website (Platform) or interact with our Services even if you do not enter any information.
            Generally,
            aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that
            compiled information. Scraper API uses aggregate information to provide its Services, as well as to
            determine the use of our Website (Platform) and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to
            our
            business metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may use aggregate information to improve the Website and Services, to monitor traffic and general
            usage
            patterns, and for other general business purposes. We may disclose aggregate information to third
            parties
            for a variety of business reasons, including to potential investors so that they may better understand
            our
            user base, etc. Aggregate information will not include any personal information and we will not disclose
            any
            personal information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            When you access our Website, Platform or use our Services, we may collect information regarding your IP
            address for the purposes of administering the Website (Platform) and tracking Website (Platform) usage.
            However, your IP address may vary each time you visit or it may remain the same depending on the type of
            Internet connection you are using or the location from which you access the Website (Platform).
        </p>

        <p>
            We may also collect information about the websites that directed you to our Website (Platform) after you
            clicked on a text or banner link or an ad from another website, or the day and time you visited our
            Website
            (Platform) and how long you spent on the Website (Platform). We aggregate such information to help us to
            compile reports as to trends and other behavior about users visiting our Website. However, such
            information
            is anonymous and cannot be tied directly to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may also use “cookies” and your personal information to enhance your experience on the Website,
            Platform
            and with the Services and to provide you with personalized offers. A cookie is a small data file placed
            on
            your computer’s hard drive that contains information that allows us to track your activity on the
            Website
            (Platform). The cookie itself does not contain any personal information; however, if you provide us with
            any
            personal information the cookie may act as an identifier to tie your personal information to your IP
            address
            or computer. You may choose to delete cookies from your computer’s hard drive at any time or to disable
            cookies on your computer. If you delete cookies that relate to the Website, we may not be able to
            identify
            you upon your return to the Website. Additionally, if you disable your computer’s cookies, you may not
            be
            able to access certain features of the Website, Platform or Services that require that cookies be
            enabled.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Website’s (Platform’s) cookies cannot be used to read data from your hard drive and cannot retrieve
            information from any other cookies created by other websites. Additionally, our cookies cannot be used
            as a
            virus, Trojan horse, worm, or any other malicious tool that could impair your use of your computer. Our
            cookies are used to help us better understand how you and other users use the Website (Platform) so we
            can
            continue to provide a better, more personalized user experience on the Website. We also share website
            usage
            information about our Website (Platform) with those interested in running targeted promotional campaigns
            on
            the Website. For this purpose, we and our advertisers track some of the pages that you visit on the
            Website
            through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).
        </p>

        <h2>Security Pertaining to Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
            alteration,
            disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
            processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
            unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
        </p>

        <p>
            We restrict access to collected information to Scraper API employees, service providers and agents who
            need
            to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are
            bound
            by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal
            prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology to
            encrypt and protect the security of your personal information, including but not limited to your credit
            card
            number, when it is sent over the Internet.
        </p>

        <h2>Integrity of Your Data</h2>
        <p>
            Scraper API processes your information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in
            accordance
            with this Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only
            collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our Services. We take
            reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current,
            but
            we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>Children and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our Website, Platform and Services is not directed to children and we will not request personally
            identifiable information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, unless we have obtained
            verifiable parental consent from a parent or legal guardian. If we become aware that a user under the
            age of
            18 has registered with our Website, Platform or Services, provided personal information, and Scraper API
            has
            not obtained prior verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian, we will immediately remove the
            user’s
            personal information from our files.
        </p>

        <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>
            The Website (Platform) may contain links to websites operated by other people or companies. Those
            websites
            may have their own privacy policy or no privacy policy at all. Scraper API does not have any
            responsibility
            for those websites, and we provide the links solely for the convenience of our visitors.
        </p>

        <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            In the event that Scraper API sells substantially all of its assets, or one of Scraper API’s business
            units
            is acquired, personal information of Users will likely be one of the transferred assets.
        </p>

                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Having built many web scrapers, we repeatedly went through the tiresome process of finding
                        proxies, setting up headless browsers, and handling CAPTCHAs. That's why we decided to start
                        Scraper API, it handles all of this for you so you can scrape any page with a simple API
